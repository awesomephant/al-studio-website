  "content": "## Adalberto Lonardi (AL) is an interdisciplinary practice focused on developing creative strategies to empower the community through the power of design and art.\n\nAL delivers communication strategies, spatial concepts, and activity programmes looking at the social needs of tomorrow. The studio develops simple ideas, meaningful narratives, and attractive aesthetics that contribute to children’s and adults’ education, cultural integration, and community empowerment. \n\nAL works collaboratively with clients and organisations to design smart formats, envision new programmes and interconnect disciplines. The practice rotates around the sinergy between a group of design specialists including photoghers, front-end developers, graphic designer and architects. A balance between creativity, methodology, and care describes the approach to our everyday design.\n\nAL believes in sustainable, long-lasting alternatives; seeks to reuse, retrain, remarket the available resources; thinks with a simple and universal language; believes in a design where community, sustainability, and simplicity are the assets for a prosperous future.\n\n*This website is designed with a sustainable and inclusive mindset. We used a simple layout, simple language, reduced and optimized images, systems fonts, good color contrast, keyboard navigation, images' alt-text caption, clean code, and improved SEO.*",
