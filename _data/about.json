We seek simple, straightforward solutions, bold aesthetics, and meaningful narratives to develop projects that contribute to children’s and adults’ education, social integration, and community empowerment. A balanced combination of creativity, methodology, and care describes the approach to our everyday design.\n\nWe believe in sustainable, long-lasting, and social-based design solutions. We believe in reuse, reintegrate, retrain, remarket the available resources. We believe in a simple, inclusive and universal language. We believe in a design approach where community, sustainability, and simplicity are the assets for a prosperous living.",
