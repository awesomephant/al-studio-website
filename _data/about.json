  "content": "## Adalberto Lonardi (AL) is an interdisciplinary practise focused on developing creative strategies to empower the community through art and design.\n\nAL delivers communication strategies, spatial concepts, and activity programmes looking at the social needs of tomorrow. The studio develops simple ideas, meaningful narratives, and attractive aesthetics that contribute to children’s and adults’ education, cultural integration, and community empowerment. \n\nAL works collaboratively with clients and organisations to design smart formats, envision new programmes and interconnect disciplines. The practice rotates around the synergy between a group of design specialists including photographers, front-end developers, graphic designer and architects. A balance between creativity, methodology, and care describes the approach to the studio everyday design.\n\nAL believes in sustainable, long-lasting alternatives; seeks to reuse, retrain, remarket the available resources; thinks with a simple and universal language; believes in a design where community, sustainability, and simplicity are the assets for a prosperous future.\n\n<p class=\"small\">\nThis website is designed with an inclusive and sustainable mindset.
