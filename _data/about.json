  "content": "## Italian-born Adalberto Lonardi is a multidisciplinary artist, working at the intersection of art and design and with a focus on local communities. He develops creative strategies to empower community groups through his design and art.\n\nAfter training as a designer at Fabrica by Benetton and earning a Master’s degree in Interior Design at the Royal College of Art, Adalberto worked in the arts and design fields and set up his studio. He won the RCA School of Architecture 2020 Student of the Year Award and the Climate/ Spatial Justice Prize for The United Generations project. \n\nAdalberto’s practice interweaves culture and design with art education at all age and ability levels; his style is marked by the simplicity of forms yet bold in aesthetics thus making it accessible to his students and audiences alike. His art seeks to enable local voices and help transform their collective vision into art – by the community for the community. Integral to the realisation of his projects is the management of sociocultural organisations and specialists including artisans, designers, architects, videomakers, photographers and digital developers.\n\nAmong his recent projects include participation at a satellite event of the Venice Biennale, and projects with Wimbledon Foundation, Southwark Cathedral, Kensington and Chelsea Art Week, Chelsea Fire Station Mural, Nine Elms Art Trail, and Chelsea and Westminster Hospital. He was also shortlisted for the Dulwich Picture Gallery and Tessa Jowell Health Centre art project. \n\nHe is an Associate Lecturer at the London College of Communication (UAL) and Chief Creative Officer at Battersea-based leading community organization, Katherine Low Settlement.\n\n<aside class='note'>\nThis website is designed with an inclusive and sustainable mindset.
