  "content": "## Adalberto Lonardi is an interdisciplinary practice focused on developing creative strategies to empower communities through design and art.\n\nWe deliver communication and spatial strategies, programmes, and prototypes looking at the social needs of tomorrow. We seek simple solutions, meaningful narratives, and beautiful aesthetics to develop projects that contribute to children’s and adults’ education, social integration, and community empowerment. \n\nWe work with organisations who choose to be different. We work collaboratively to design smart formats, envision new programmes and interconnect disciplines. A balance between creativity, methodology, and care describes the approach to our everyday design.\n\nWe believe in sustainable, long-lasting, and social-based design solutions. We believe in reuse, reintegrate, retrain, remarket the available resources. We believe in a simple, inclusive and universal language. We believe in a design approach where community, sustainability, and simplicity are the assets for a prosperous living.",
