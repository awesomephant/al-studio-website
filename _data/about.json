  "content": "## Interdisciplinary is a communication and architecture practice developing creative strategies to empower the community trough art and design. \n\nFounded in 2015 by Adalberto Lonardi, we specialise in architecture and visual communication concepts focused on the social needs of tomorrow. We seek simple, straightforward solutions, bold aesthetics, and meaningful narratives to develop projects that will contribute to children’s and adults’ education, social integration, and community empowerment. A balanced combination of creativity, methodology, and care describes the approach to our everyday design.\n\nWe believe in sustainable, long-lasting, and social-solutions based design solutions. We believe in reuse, reintegrate, retrain, remarket the available resources. We believe in a simple, inclusive and universal language. We believe in a design where community, sustainability, and simplicity are the assets for a prosperous living.",
