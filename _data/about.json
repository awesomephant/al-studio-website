  "content": "## Adalberto Lonardi is an interdisciplinary practice focused on developing creative strategies to empower the community through design and art.\n\nWe deliver communication strategies, spatial concepts, and activity programmes looking at the social needs of tomorrow. We develop simple ideas, meaningful narratives, and attractive aesthetics that contribute to children’s and adults’ education, cultural integration, and community empowerment. \n\nWe work collaboratively with organisations to design smart formats, envision new programmes and interconnect disciplines. A balance between creativity, methodology, and care describes the approach to our everyday design.\n\nWe believe in sustainable, long-lasting alternatives. We seek to reuse, retrain, remarket the available resources. We think with a simple and universal language. We believe in a design where community, sustainability, and simplicity are the assets for a prosperous living.\n\n*This website is designed with a sustainable and inclusive mindset. We used a simple layout, comprehensive text, reduced and optimized images, systems fonts, good color contrast, keyboard navigation, images' alt-text caption, clean code, improved SEO, and green hosting.*",
