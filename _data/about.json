  "content": "## Adalberto Lonardi is an interdisciplinary practice focused on developing creative strategies to empower communities through design and art.\n\nWe deliver communication strategies, spatial concepts, and activity programmes looking at the social needs of tomorrow. We seek simple solutions, meaningful narratives, and beautiful aesthetics to contribute to children’s and adults’ education, social integration, and community empowerment. \n\nWe work collaboratively with organisations to design smart formats, envision new programmes and interconnect disciplines. A balance between creativity, methodology, and care describes the approach to our everyday design.\n\nWe believe in sustainable, long-lasting design solutions. We believe in reuse, retrain, remarket the available resources. We believe in a simple, inclusive and universal language. We believe in a design approach where community, sustainability, and simplicity are the assets for a prosperous living.\n\n*This website is designed with a sustainable and inclusive plan in mind. We used a simple layout, comprehensive text, reduced and optimized images, systems fonts, good color contrast, keyboard navigation, images' alt-text caption, clean code, improved SEO, and green hosting.*",
