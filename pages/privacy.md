## Here's a headline

**To give a bit of context**: My name is José García Oliva and I was born in Caracas, Venezuela. When I came to the Royal College of Art, I re­alised that the ﬁrst con­tact I had with peo­ple from South America in London were the clean­ers work­ing at the College: Julian, Jorge and Diego from Colombia, and Javier from Bolivia.

The ﬁrst thing I thought was, why are they all South American? Isn’t this just an­other por­trait of post-colo­nial­ism? South Americans clean­ing, Africans guard­ing, Europeans teach­ing. I started talk­ing to one of them for hours about types of South American food dishes (mainly ar­gu­ing whether arepas are Colombian or Venezuelan), gos­sip­ing about peo­ple pass­ing by in the halls, mi­gra­tion poli­cies, EU set­tle­ment, Brexit, and so on. Between those con­ver­sa­tions, I asked him: Why do you think you are all from South America? He said: “Latinos are very ser­vice­able, and peo­ple here like that.” Since I heard that an­swer, I have tasted the bit­ter­ness of colo­nial­is­m’s ashes, still warm, in my mouth. “Latinos are proud to be work­ing, even in a hole.” The prob­lem is that a hole will al­low them to bury you, and af­ter the hole is cov­ered up, every­one can step on you.
