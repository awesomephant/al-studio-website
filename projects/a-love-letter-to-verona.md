Site-specific art installation as a tribute to the city of Verona and its wine culture. The installation showcases the most famous monuments of the city, and highlights the value that the community places on wine. The colour set design creates two three-dimensional spaces, incorporating wines from Pasqua and Coin products in the storefront of Coin Excelsior in Verona.
