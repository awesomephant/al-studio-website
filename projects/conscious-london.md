Digital art direction and visual identity for the Conscious London 2020, a chapter of the Conscious Cities Movement, part of [The Centre for Conscious Design (CCD)](https://theccd.org/). The visual identity included multiple social media assets and infographics for the three-day event.

Conscious London 2020 brought together multidisciplinary speakers for an online three-day cultural programme of talks, conversations, screenings and virtual visits to inspire and connect the science, design and creative communities.

*To view the design and watch the talks please visit: [Conscious London](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-Bbwz5OiTCqCCmIH9RQxwA)*
