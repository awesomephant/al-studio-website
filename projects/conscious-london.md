Co-created visual identity for the Conscious London (CCL) 2020 Festival, a chapter of the Conscious Cities Movement, part of [The Centre for Conscious Design (CCD)](https://theccd.org/). The visual identity included multiple social media assets and infographics for the three-day event which brought together multidisciplinary speakers for an online cultural programme of talks, conversations, screenings and virtual visits to inspire and connect the science, design and creative communities.
