Digital art direction for the Conscious London 2020, a chapter of the Conscious Cities Movement, part of [The Centre for Conscious Design (CCD)](https://theccd.org/). The visual identity included mutliple social media assets and infographics for the three-day event.

Conscious London 2020 brought together multidisciplinary speakers for an online three-day cultural programme of talks, conversations, screenings and virtual visits to inspire and connect the science, design and creative communities.

To view the design and watch the three sessions please visit: [Conscious London](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-Bbwz5OiTCqCCmIH9RQxwA)
