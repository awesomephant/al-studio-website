*Finestra Paradiso* is a site-specific glass artwork located in the entrance corridor of a private residence in Verona. Inspired by the exile of the Italian Renaissance poet and writer Dante Alighieri, who wrote Paradiso, the final part of The Divine Comedy, during his time in the city, the piece reimagines Dante’s symbolic Candida Rosa. 

This vast, heavenly rose—representing divine love—welcomes guests into the home. The artwork was developed in collaboration with Progetto Arte Poli, a world-leading company specialising in producing Renaissance fine art in Verona. The piece incorporates six types of coloured glass, each meticulously cut and hand-assembled by master craftsmen.
