"Follow the Star" is a community-led mural depicting a modern take on the traditional nativity scene. The piece, set in a house in Battersea, imagines a diverse and multi-cultural Battersea adoring a newborn light, surrounded by local landmarks and characters. Ideas and drawings were incorporated into the mural following an intergenerational workshop with the children from St Georgeâ€™s CE Primary and the elders from Katherine Low Settlement. The artwork was painted with the help of 20 locals, creatives and hotel residents during 5 open studio days.
