"Follow the Star" is a community-led mural displayed at art'otel London Battersea Power Station in collaboration with Nine Elms Arts Ministry. The piece depicts a modern take on the traditional nativity scene and, set in a house in Battersea, imagines a diverse and multi-cultural Battersea adoring a newborn light, surrounded by local landmarks and characters. Ideas and drawings were incorporated into the mural following an intergenerational workshop with the children from St George’s CE Primary and the elders from Katherine Low Settlement. The artwork was painted with the help of 20 locals, creatives and hotel residents during 5 open studio days.
