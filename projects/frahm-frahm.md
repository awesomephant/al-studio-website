AL art directed and designed the new Frahm & Frahm website. F&F specialises in producing large-scale institutional exhibitions, collaborating on special projects with major contemporary artists and building some of the worldâ€™s great private art collections. The minimal and elegant design wants to celebrate the Frahm brothers' projects' visual documentation through a clean grid layout and large scale images and films. The information has been carefully selected on each page to present only the essential and guide the visitor intuitively through the website. The individual works can be discovered from the general Projects page using a year filtering system on the top timeline. Most of the projects are accompanied by poetic short documentaries collected in the Films section. The News page tells the projects' stories in a one-column archive that can be browsed filtering by artists and location.
