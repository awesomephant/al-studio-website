‘Everybody Champions’ is a community-led art project produced in collaboration with Wimbledon and London charity Katherine Low Settlement (KLS) to celebrate equality and diversity in sports and tennis. Adalberto Lonardi designed four mixed-media embroidery wall hangings combining elements from 40 drawings made by 60 young and older members of the KLS community. The project enlisted the expertise of four professional textile artists leading the production of one of the wall hangings in textile community workshops. These artworks have been exhibited at The Wimbledon Lawn Tennis Museum and Battersea Power Station.

**'Above the Grounds'**
by Livia Papiernik: depicting Centre Court from above during a Wimbledon and KLS match, this wall hanging features intricate embroidery and patchwork created in collaboration with the KLS Elders Programme. 

**'Hand to Hand'**
by Chloe Rochefort: featuring a large open hand decorated with multicultural motifs, holding a colourful tennis ball and a larger-than-life tennis racket, representing unity and community collaboration.

**'All We Need is Equality'**
by Kate Amis: depicting a woman of colour proudly looking forward in front of a net on Centre Court. The Championship platter and trophy represent achievement and celebrate equality and respect, core values shared by KLS.

**'KLS & Wimbledon'**
Vidushi Chenna: featuring a bold typographic element, this wall hanging showcases multicultural figures playing tennis, framed by colourful flowers and ethnic motifs. The production involved around 20 individuals from the KLS community.
