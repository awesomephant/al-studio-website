Curated the printed and digital visual communication for the public lecture series, Inside-Out, run by the RCA School of Architecture, Interior Design Programme. The lectures are concerned with interrogating and understanding the interior architecture spaces as a medium of expression of individuals in the urban space, and an opportunity of experience for the collectivity.
