Kaledoscopio is a child-sized art centre aimed at developing the children creative potentials. Artistic laboratories where the child can create and experiment his skills, offer the possibility of a re-evaluation of those activities and emotions addressed to develop a better self.

‘…And thus they tell the child that the hundred is not there. The child says: No way. The hundred is there.’ (Loris Malaguzzi, The Hundred Languages 1987).
