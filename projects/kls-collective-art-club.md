From Creative Health: The Arts for Health and Wellbeing Report (2017): "...Participatory arts activities in healthcare and social care environments help to alleviate anxiety, depression and stress while increasing resilience and wellbeing."

The Collective Art Club focuses on drawing, painting activities and creating collective artworks. The project welcomes 50+ adults and older people with all technical levels and without previous experience requirements. The Club provides a safe and relaxed environment where older people meet other members of the local community and create together.
