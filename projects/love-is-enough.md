*Love is Enough* is a ceramic tableware series with at the centre the idea of universal love and an ode to my hometown Verona. A love without gender, without age, without race. The unconditional virtue that we share every day with our families, friends and neighbours. 

The collection of cylindrical plates, bowls and vases takes to the table the themes of care, love and compassion. It is a modern reinterpretation of traditional folk art on ceramics, with a strong reference to figurative Italian ceramics from the 14th and 15th centuries. This collection is a piece of art, a collectable design, and a high-end product.

The production has an essential intergenerational element. The collection has been created in collaboration with ceramic artist Anna Grazia Perlini in Verona.
