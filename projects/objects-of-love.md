A decorative ceramics workshop in collaboration with Nine Elms Arts Ministry at The Alchemist, a hospitality venue based in Nine Elms, London. Part of the Creative Soul Café Programme, the session focused on the techniques of transferring and painting abstract concepts such as love and community into a colourful ceramic piece. There were 21 attendees from the local area, with participants mainly consisting of women of varying ages and backgrounds. Creative Soul Café is about giving a space to nurture mental wellbeing through creativity for adults of all abilities and no art skills needed. These workshops are free thanks to support from Battersea Power Station and Dominus Group.
