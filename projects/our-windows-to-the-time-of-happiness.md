60 minutes screening based on sky colour changing gradients. The colours are picked from a series of photographs taken at pure dusk and downs titled 'Our windows to the time of happiness'.

“Our windows to the time of happiness” is a collection of dusks and dawns photographs, portrayed as pure ever-changing tones, shot from my family house over two years. In a time when a global crisis is happening and the grey exterior environment becomes hostile to survive, I propose to look from our interior windows at the colorful sky to dream, find peace and celebrate what happiness means - the essential.
