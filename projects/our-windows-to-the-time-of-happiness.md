AL designed a digital art installation for a private community event in East London. The artwork consisted of a 60 minutes screening animation of the sky's changing gradients created with digital software. The colours tones are picked from a series of photographs titled Our Windows to the Time of Happiness: a collection of dusks and dawns, portrayed as pure ever-changing tones, shot over two years. When a global crisis is happening, and the grey exterior environment becomes hostile to survive, AL proposes to look from the interior windows at the colourful sky to dream, find peace and celebrate what happiness means - the essential.
