Reconnections is a hand-painted ceramic tableware commissioned by the Nine Elms Arts Ministry. The artefact represents the infinite cycle of three stories in time. Set in different landscapes, the paintings capture our intimate relationship with the earth - from green lands to calming waters, and from mountains to warm mystical dunes.\

“Last year we started restoring the values within our community and finding a new balance. Today we strive to reconnect and build a new world. We look for kingdoms where peace and kindness are our new wealth, as we shape new landscapes and territories”. The piece is produced in collaboration with ceramic artist [Steph Buttle](http://www.stephaniebuttle.com/objects).
