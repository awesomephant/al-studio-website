For Pride 2023 the Foster + Partners headquarters are wrapped as a warm hug by a 300-meter-long colourful ribbon drawn by the office staff and the wider local LGBTQ+ community through a series of workshops. The ribbon acts as a reminder that inclusivity, equality and freedom start from internal ethical and moral changes within corporate organizations.
