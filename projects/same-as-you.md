New research released today by charity [@thtorguk](https://www.instagram.com/thtorguk/) has revealed 74% of people living with HIV in the UK have experienced stigma or discrimination because of their HIV status.

Two people facing each other. Perhaps the same person looking at themselves. They are equal. As undetectable is equal to untransmittable (U=U). As a person living with HIV has the equal right to any other human being to look at themselves in the mirror without fear, guilt or shame and prejudgement. Thanks to modern medicine and years of advocacy, it is time to look at HIV as a potential rather than a restriction.\

Today living a normal life with HIV is possible.
