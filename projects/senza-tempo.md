Senza Tempo is a site-responsive, 10 meters textile artwork for Pasqua Wines at the Italian Embassy in London to open Frieze London 2024. Informed by a palindromic poem titled ‘Infinitamente’, the piece celebrates the infinite thread that connects us all with past traditions and future generations.

The artwork was created using a combination of digital and handcrafted work. Printed on knitted polyester, the piece was enriched on both sides with 52 hours of hand-made inserts of precious fabrics such as organza, chiffon, and velvet. It also includes details like the silver silk cut-out letters that form the palindromic Italian poem.
