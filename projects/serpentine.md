‘Serpentine’ is an inflatable installation at the Women and Children’s Federal Building, created in collaboration with Cashart, in Shenzhen, China to celebrate the Year of the Snake. The large-scale artwork has been imagined as a giant, playful snake designed to blend into the vibrant surroundings. As snakes in nature are defined by scales and lines, I replicated these patterns on the sculpture itself. A modular, multicoloured scale motif runs along the spine of the artwork, taking cues from the building’s architecture and the five-colour palette introduced by MVRDV. In partnership with T-LIGHT, the sculpture is illuminated to provide a dynamic, day-to-night experience for families and visitors. A digital illustration accompanies the physical installation, depicting a familiar Chinese New Year celebration. 新年快乐
