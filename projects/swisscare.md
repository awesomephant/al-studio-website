Natural supplements and cosmetics brand Swisscare claimed a fresh look for their new visual identity. The assets ranged from stationery and brochures to website, social media and large scale digitally printed canvases. AL designed a highly customized botanical language and applied it to both printed and digital material as an individual element or pattern. The identity was developed based on the brand seasonal products.
