A spatial design proposal for the Nativity Museum of London inspired by the cones of vision of Renaissance nativity paintings. The museum entrance hosts three temporary sculptural objects. The sight cones, translated into the threedimensional dark space as glowing colourful pyramids, create a network, allowing visitors to visually connect with the other parts of the building. The cones also become private spaces creating a bar, a children play room and a meditative grotto.
