Allegrini Wine Discovery Museum is a spatial design proposal for one of the leading local winery in the Valpolicella region in Verona (IT). Allegrini winery wishes to enhance its visitorsâ€™ experience by adding to the property a new building that will host the brand wine museum. The traditional terracing techniques and the dry-stone walls characterizing the surrounding territory are the inspiration of the monolithic architecture which features a multi-level structure welcoming a vast exhibition space and a rooftop wine shop/bar.
