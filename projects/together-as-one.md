When the world changes and pulls us apart, we need to reconnect with one another and live again together as one. From our neighbours to our houses, to our families, we must look at our past to draw a radiant future. Reconnecting with our history, our traditions and the people who shaped us is essential to find who we truly are.

Together as one is a site-specific handpainted mural proposal to create the fifth Love Kensington + Chelsea mural located on a hoarding on Lawnsdone Road in Notting Hill. The artwork celebrates the power of the Notting Hill community as a symbol of hope and harmony for tomorrow. Inspired by the neighbourhood’s history and the architectural restoration of the site, the drawings represent three stories in time. 

The first panel depicts a time when pottery making and farming brought together the rural Knottynghull village. It’s the celebration of a ceramics production among young and old residents surrounded by the animals with the iconic kilns in the background. The second panel represents an early Portobello Market where the relationships between fruits and vegetable vendors and customers were vital to energise the life of the borough’s streets. The third panel shows the intimate moment of a family preparing for Carnival inside a recently renovated Georgian house.
