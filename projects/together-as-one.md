Together as one is a site-specific handpainted mural proposal to create the fifth Love Kensington + Chelsea mural located on a hoarding on Lansdowne Road in Notting Hill. The artwork celebrates the power of the Notting Hill community as a symbol of hope and harmony for tomorrow. Inspired by the neighbourhood’s history and the architectural restoration of the site, the drawings represent three stories in time.
