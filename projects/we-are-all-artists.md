*We Are All Artists* is a large-scale collaborative painting by Adalberto Lonardi and the elders to celebrate the creative group and the important role of Katherine Low Settlement in the local community. The painting represents the twelve artists on Battersea High Street in front of KLSâ€™s iconic building. The drawing was created during workshops where the members chose how they would like to be portrayed and the symbols that represent them. The elders also took part in the production process, painting their own figures and supporting each other throughout. In the centre of the composition, a woman holding the key of the community centre represents the founder of the establishment Katherine Mackay Low. The painting took four days to complete and more than twenty-four hands worked on it.
