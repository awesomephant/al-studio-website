A series of intergenerational and multicultural workshops was held at Wimbledon Tennis to create a set of illustrations that celebrate the beauty of equality in tennis and recall the icons of Wimbledon. A total of 30 drawings were made by 60 members of London-based charity, Katherine Low Settlement. These illustrations are assembled into four large-scale panels and the designs are assigned to four professional textile artists who will lead the production of the pieces by facilitating sewing and embroidery sessions with the local community.
